# Vehicle-Load-Weight-Monitoring-System
This project focuses on the creation of a Passenger and Load weight monitoring system
that logs the weights of individual passengers and the luggage stored in the luggage
bay of the vehicle.the Vehicle of primary focus is the Inter city Public service Bus. 
The weights will be monitored and Logged using a load cell placed on one of the entrance
steps on the vehicle and one placed in the luggage bay. Motion sensors will be used to 
detect the motion of passengers entering and exiting the vehicle. The total load
weight (Passengers and Luggage) will be tracked and monitored to ensure it does 
not exceed a prescribed limit.
